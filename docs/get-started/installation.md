# Installation

You can install Flux via the plugin store, or through Composer.

## Craft Plugin Store

To install Flux, navigate to the Plugin Store section of your Craft control panel, search for `Flux` and click the Try button.

## Composer

You can also add the package to your project using Composer and the command line.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

```shell
cd /path/to/project
```

2. Then tell Composer to require the plugin, and Craft to install it:

```shell
composer require dyerc/craft-flux
```

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings â†’ Plugins and click the **Install** button for Flux.

## Licensing

You can try Flux in a development environment for as long as you like. Once your site goes live, you are required to purchase a license for the plugin.
