## How expensive is Flux to run?

Explaining AWS pricing is way beyond the scope of this FAQ section, however the essential points are:

- All charges are proportional to the number of images being served
- S3 charge for transformed asset storage
- Lambda charges for redirecting to cached resources and processing an image

#### Image Serving (Viewer Request Function)

*Below are example approximate Lambda costs assuming a 128MB memory allocation. These are purely to give you a rough idea.*
| Request Count | Billed Duration | Price       |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 1             |    ~ 40ms       |  $0.0000016 |
| 10K           |    ~ 40ms       |  $0.017     |
| 1M            |    ~ 40ms       |  $2.40      |

#### Image Processing (Origin Response Function)

*Below are example approximate Lambda costs assuming a 512MB memory allocation. These are purely to give you a rough idea.*
| Output Image Size | Billed Duration | Price     |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Very Small  ~70px |           360ms | $0.000009 |
| Small   ~500px    |           500ms | $0.000012 |

- Delete the IAM user you created when installing Flux
